## Core Functionality
This is a browser extension to bridge YouTube with [Tube Archivist](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist), your self hosted YouTube media server.
- Add your Tube Archivist connection details in the addon popup.
- On YouTube video pages, inject a download button to download that video and a subscribe button to subscribe to that channel.
- On YouTube channel pages, inject a button to subscribe to the channel or download the complete channel. Regarding the channel subpages, this follows the same rules as adding to the queue over the form.
- Throughout most places, hover over the video title to reveal a download button for that video.
- Sync your cookies for yt-dlp.

## Test this extension
Before continuing loading the temporary extension here, make sure to deactivate/delete the main extension first.

Symlink/copy the correct manifest file for your browser to the expected location, e.g. `ln -s manifest-firefox.json manifest.json`.

- Firefox
  - Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
  - Click on *Load Temporary Add-on*
  - Select the *manifest.json* file to load the addon.
  - You can *inspect* background.js by lunching the debug tools from there.
- Chrome / Chromium
  - Open `chrome://extensions/`
  - Toggle *Developer mode* on top right
  - Click on *Load unpacked*
  - Open the folder containing the *manifest.json* file.
  - Click on *Service Worker* to open the dev tools at background.js. 

## Compatibility
- Verify that you are running the [latest version](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist/releases/latest) of Tube Archivist as the API is under development and will change.
- For testing this extension between releases, use the *unstable* builds of Tube Archivist, only for your testing environment.

## Roadmap
Join us on [Discord](https://www.tubearchivist.com/discord) and help us improve and extend this project. This is a list of planned features, in no particular order:
- [ ] Implement download/subscribe button for playlists
- [ ] Add download buttons to the `/shorts/` pages
- [X] Get download and subscribe status from TA to show on the injected buttons
- [X] Implement download button for videos on the YouTube homepage over inline preview
- [X] Implement download button for videos on playlist
- [X] Error handling for connection errors
- [X] Dynamically inject buttons with mutation observer

## Making changes to the JavaScript
The JavaScript does not require any build step; you just edit the files directly. However, there is config for eslint and prettier (a linter and formatter respectively); their use is recommended but not required. To use them, install `node`, run `npm i` from the root directory of this repository to install dependencies, then run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` to run eslint and prettier respectively.

## Updating Artwork
Google listing is *very* picky. Screenshots need to be exactly **1280x800** in resolution and need to be in *jpg* or *png* without alpha canal.
